This app stores longitude and latitude coordinates of places your phone was and
when your phone was there.

This concept could be expanded to track many peopleâ€™s driving habits, compare
those habits with their driving records, develop a model of good driving habits
based on phone location data, and then provide incentive for drivers to switch
to a particular insurance company that provides discounts based on driving
patterns. Every time you drive, you can reduce your insurance a bit.
This may resultantly incentivize people to drive safer.
