This app stores longitude and latitude coordinates of places your phone was and
when your phone was there.

This concept could be expanded to track many people’s driving habits, compare
those habits with their driving records, develop a model of good driving habits
base on phone location data, and then provide incentive for drivers to switch
to a particular insurance company that provides discounts based on driving
patterns. Every time you drive, you can reduce your insurance a bit.
This may resultantly incentivize people to drive safer.
